# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App].

## Project Title

## About the app
eworld is my phase-2 project with Academy Xi. The main goal of the project is to showcase the concepts I have learnt throughout the phase-2 module.
I wanted to imitate a social media application because it is resembles a large scale application, which is one of the main reason of using React. 
The main features of this web application comes from using full CRUD actions with fetch from my db json server to allow the user to interact with posts, friends and their profile.
Some main React concepts I've implemented in this project are:
- Components
- Import and export
- JSX
- Props
- State
- Controlled inputs
- Event handling
- useEffect hook
- Client-side routing, React Router v5

## Technologies
I began this project by using create-react-app, it is one of the best way to start building a single-page application in React.

I also used JavaScript and CSS to build and finish the project.

For a Node server, I followed the json-server-template(https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/json-server-template) 
to build a database. Afterwards, I used a free service called Render(https://render.com/) to deploy my Node server. This way, I don't need to
setup and run my server locally every time I need to work on my project.

Finally, once I finished my project I used another free service called Netlify(https://www.netlify.com/) to deploy my application.

## Setup
To view, explore and experiment with the source code, fork and clone this repository, then run "npm install" then "npm start".

Once the app is running in the browser you will be directed to the login page. Simply put
- Username: user
- Password: react123

## Approach
I settled with a social media application because it is one of the common applications built using react. I used FaceBook as my main and only inspiration.
I copied their color scheme using a Google extention called ColorZilla. I tried my best to imitate the website layout, using mostly grid and flex display.
I also used best practices such as using components for my header and other parts of the website and React router to navigate to different parts of the
website, changing the URL while maintaining a single-page application.

## Status
This project is finished and I don't plan working on it any further.

## Credits
Thank you to Academy Xi for giving the main bulk of resources I need.
