## About the app
eworld is my phase-2 project with Academy Xi. The main goal of the project is to showcase the main concepts I have learnt throughout the phase-2 module.
I wanted to imitate a social media application because it is one of the main applications that is built using react and to demonstrate react tools such as,
components, props, hooks, react router and data fetching.

## Technologies
I began this project by using create-react-app, it is one of the best way to start building a single-page application in React.

I also used JavaScript and CSS to build and finish the project.

For a Node server, I followed the json-server-template(https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/json-server-template) 
to build a database. Afterwards, I used a free service called Render(https://render.com/) to deploy my Node server. This way, I don't need to
setup and run my server locally every time I need to work on my project.

Finally, once I finished my project I used another free service called Netlify(https://www.netlify.com/) to deploy my application.

## Setup
To view, explore and experiment with the source code, fork and clone this repository, then run "npm install" then "npm start". Feel free to push to your
cloned repo but pushing the main branch is not allowed.

Once the app is running in the browser you will be directed to the login page. Simply put
Username: esantiago
Password: edmond123

## Approach
I settled with a social media application because it is one of the common applications built using react. I used FaceBook as my main and only inspiration.
I copied their color scheme using a Google extention called ColorZilla. I tried my best to imitate the website layout, using mostly grid and flex display.
I also used best practices such as using components for my header and other parts of the website and React router to navigate to different parts of the
website, changing the URL while maintaining a single-page application.

## Status
This project is finished and I don't plan working on it any further.
